                <p class="quoting">"The Federal Reserve system relies on the force of government to maintain 
                its monopoly power on the issuance of money. This is how all central banks
                maintain their control. Without the state's involvement, people would be 
                free to use whatever currency they like. Historically this was gold. If the
                founders of the fed tried to do what they did w/o the Federal Reserve Act 
                legislation, and later the Brenton Woods agreement, they would have failed 
                miserably. No one would have bought into their system."</p>
